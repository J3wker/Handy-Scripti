handy scripts i write during PT and i think would help others


# masscanner-beautifier.py
Date: 26/07/2020

A script to output your mascan results nicely from an XML format
Organize them in a folder - and create txt files for each ports to see which IPs
are open on which ports - for example:

22.txt
    127.0.0.1
    192.168.1.1

Also - Active mod will scan with -sC -sV the ports that masscan reported as open
Passive will only do the stuff i mentioned above
